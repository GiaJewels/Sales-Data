# 📊 Sales Data Analysis and Management Project

## Project Overview
This group project focuses on exploring a **real-world sales dataset** (`Week-2, Sales-Data.csv`) to apply core concepts in **data collection, management, cleaning, and analysis**. The project utilizes both **Microsoft Excel** for quick insights and **Python with pandas** for robust data processing and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) calculation.

**Key Topics Covered:**
* Data lifecycle & governance
* Structured vs unstructured data
* File formats (CSV, JSON, XML, SQL)
* Data cleaning and preparation
* Data summarization and visualization

## Part A: Data Exploration and Description

### 1. Data Type and Column Purpose

#### Type of Data and Why
This dataset comprises **structured data**  because it is organized in a straightforward, tabular manner with consistent rows and columns that follow a predictable pattern. Because each record has standardized fields and reflects a sales transaction, both analytical tools and people can read it with ease. Since structured data can be handled effectively in databases and spreadsheet programs, the data adheres to a strict schema in which each item has the same set of properties.

#### Column Purpose Explanation
| Column Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Order_ID** | Functions as a distinct tracking identifier for every sales transaction; it is comparable to a receipt number that aids in the system's identification of specific orders. |
| **Product** | Indicates the kind of goods that were sold, including the precise item that each consumer bought. |
| **Region** | Shows how sales are dispersed around the nation by indicating the geographic location where the transaction took place. |
| **Units_Sold** | Provides information on sales volume and client purchasing trends by displaying the number of goods bought in each order. |
| **Unit_Price** | Represents the cost of a single unit of the product, helping us understand pricing strategies for various items. |
| **Revenue** | The primary financial statistic for business performance, calculated by multiplying **Units_Sold** by **Unit_Price**. |
| **Sales_Rep** | Provides commission calculations and performance monitoring by identifying the team member who closed the deal. |
| **Order_Date** | Indicates the time of each transaction, allowing for the investigation of sales trends and seasonal patterns over time. |

### 2. Summarized Sales Insights (Excel)
Using Excel's built-in tools (Pivot Tables, SUMIF, Charts), the following sales insights were generated:

| Insight | Excel Tool Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total revenue generated by each product.** | Pivot Table (Product in Rows, Sum of Revenue in Values) |
| **Total revenue by region.** | Pivot Table (Region in Rows, Sum of Revenue in Values) |
| **Top 3 best-selling products by total revenue.** | Pivot Table (Revenue sorted Descending) |
| **Monthly revenue trend.** | Pivot Table (Group Order_Date by Month, Sum of Revenue) |
| **Revenue comparison by region.** | Bar/Column Chart based on the Total Revenue by Region results.  |

## Part B: Python Data Management and KPI Calculation

### 3. Data Import and Cleaning (Python/Pandas)
The data was imported and processed in a Jupyter Notebook using the `pandas` library to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis.

#### Cleaning Steps:
1.  **Import:** Loaded `Week-2-Sales-Data.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Duplicates:** Removed any duplicate rows using the `drop_duplicates()` method.
3.  **Missing Values:** Checked for null values. Any sparse missing values were **handled by [State your chosen method: e.g., dropping the row/column, or filling with a mean/median/mode]**.
4.  **Data Types:** Converted the **Order_Date** column to the proper `datetime` format using `pd.to_datetime()`.

### 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Calculation
The cleaned dataset was used to calculate the following essential business performance metrics:

| KPI | Calculation Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total revenue for the entire dataset.** | Sum of the **Revenue** column. |
| **Average units sold per order.** | Mean (Average) of the **Units_Sold** column. |
| **Total revenue per region.** | Group by **Region** and sum the **Revenue** column. |
| **Highest revenue-generating sales representative.** | Group by **Sales_Rep**, sum **Revenue**, and identify the maximum value/representative. |
| **Top 3 products by total units sold.** | Group by **Product**, sum **Units_Sold**, and identify the top 3 (descending sort). |

## Submission & Deliverables

The final submission includes the following:

1.  **A comprehensive Excel Report:** A single worksheet summarizing all results from Part A (Q2), featuring proper headings, labels, and the required chart.
2.  **Jupyter Notebook File (.ipynb):** Containing the Python code for data import, cleaning (Part B, Q3), and the KPI calculations (Part B, Q4).
3.  **This GitHub README.md:** Providing project context and a summary of activities.
