Sales Data Analysis Project

📊 Project Overview
This project explores a real-world sales dataset to demonstrate data collection, management, cleaning, and analysis processes using both Excel and Python.

📁 Dataset Information
Type of Data and Structure
This dataset comprises structured data because it is organized in a straightforward, tabular manner with consistent rows and columns that follow a predictable pattern. Each record has standardized fields and reflects sales transactions, making it easily readable by both analytical tools and humans. The data adheres to a strict schema where each item has the same set of properties, allowing effective handling in databases and spreadsheet programs.

Column Purpose Explanation
Column	Purpose
Order_ID	Functions as a distinct tracking identifier for every sales transaction; similar to a receipt number that aids in system identification of specific orders
Product	Indicates the type of goods sold, including the precise item that each customer bought
Region	Shows sales distribution around the nation by indicating the geographic location where transactions occurred
Units_Sold	Provides information on sales volume and client purchasing patterns by displaying the number of goods bought in each order
Unit_Price	Helps understand pricing strategies for various items by representing the cost of a single product unit
Revenue	Primary financial statistic for business performance, calculated by multiplying units sold by unit price
Sales_Rep	Provides commission calculations and performance monitoring by identifying the team member who closed the deal
Order_Date	Indicates the time of each transaction, allowing investigation of sales trends and seasonal patterns over time
🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: Data exploration, pivot tables, charts, and reporting

Python: Data cleaning, analysis, and KPI calculations

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive Python environment

📋 Project Tasks
Part A - Working with Data in Excel (20 Marks)
1. Import and Explore (5 Marks)
Import the Week-2-Sales-Data.csv file into Microsoft Excel

Explore and describe the dataset structure

Identify and explain column purposes

2. Summarize Sales Insights (15 Marks)
Using Excel's built-in tools:

a) Total revenue generated by each product

b) Total revenue by region

c) Top 3 best-selling products by total revenue

d) Monthly revenue trend

e) Bar/column chart showing revenue comparison by region

Part B - Working with Data in Python (20 Marks)
3. Import and Clean the Data (5 Marks)
Using Python (pandas):

Import dataset into Jupyter Notebook

Check for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types

Clean dataset by:

Removing duplicates

Handling missing values

Converting Order_Date to proper datetime format

4. Calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (15 Marks)
Using Python to calculate:

a) Total revenue for the entire dataset

b) Average units sold per order

c) Total revenue per region

d) Highest revenue-generating sales representative

e) Top 3 products by total units sold
